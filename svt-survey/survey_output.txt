Residuals are mostly just for debug. Could use them to refine the pin basis.

Basis is a 2-element array [origin, basis_vectors]. This defines the basis in the given survey frame.

Example (L1S sensor basis in pin frame):
[array([ 124.1617,   39.2506,  -13.8204]), array([[  9.9501e-01,   9.9742e-02, -9.3294e-04],
       [  9.9743e-02,  -9.9501e-01,   1.0489e-03],
       [ -8.2366e-04,  -1.1367e-03,  -1.0000e+00]])]
In the pin frame, the sensor origin is [ 124.1617,   39.2506,  -13.8204].
In the pin frame, the sensor X-axis (strip direction) is [  9.9501e-01, 9.9742e-02, -9.3294e-04].
etc.

Sensor basis: 
+Z is the normal to the strip side of the sensor.
+X is strip direction, pointing away from the hybrid.
+Y is measurement direction, pointing towards strip 638.
Origin is the center of the sensor in XY, at the strip surface in Z.

Pin basis:
Pin positions are defined by intersection of pin axis with fixture (or U-channel pocket) surface.
+X is the vector pointing from the slot pin to the hole pin.
+Y is the normal to the fixture surface.
+Z points towards the axial sensor.
Origin is the hole pin.
For the bottom U-channels, pin basis directions should match U-channel and JLab basis directions. For the top U-channels, Y and Z should be inverted.

U-channel basis:
Ball positions are defined by the centers of 6mm balls held in the cone fiducials.
``Upstream midpoint'' is the midpoint of L1/L4 hole and slot balls.
``Downstream midpoint'' is the midpoint of L1/L4 hole and slot balls.
``Hole-to-slot vector'' is the vector from hole ball to slot ball.
+Z is the vector pointing from the upstream midpoint to the downstream midpoint.
+X is the average of the upstream and downstream hole-to-slot vectors.
+Y points up in the JLab frame.
Origin is the upstream midpoint.
U-channel basis directions should match JLab basis directions.
